# WineVariety
A text classification model for predicting wine variety based on description using word embeddings and LSTM

Dataset - [Wine Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)

Following are the tasks performed on the given dataset:

1. Drawing insights from the given reviews dataset and Data Visualization- such as winery distribution, country wise variety distribution, vintage extraction and its distribution over various varieties etc..
2. Training a prediction model for prediction of variety based on the description given by user for the wine. (Using BiLSTMs and trained word2vec word embeddings for the dataset)
